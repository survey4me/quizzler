# Quizzler 0.0.1

Quizzler is a HTML5 Gameshow that simulates a Jeopardy-esque gaming experience for educators. It is intended as a step above typical PowerPoint / slide-based games that have additional features.

Double-click through the screens.

Just to be clear, I've only just deployed the project, so there's much more work to be done.

It currently only works in Firefox 15+ out of the box; Chrome requires that you turn off web security to allow JSON files to be read locally. I'm thinking about a simple workaround for this.
